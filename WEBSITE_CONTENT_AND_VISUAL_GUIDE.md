### Typography Guidelines

- **Headings:** Bold, distinct font (e.g., Sans-serif like Inter or bold Serif).
- **Body:** Clean Sans-serif (e.g., Open Sans, Roboto) for high readability.
- **Hierarchy:** H1 for page titles, H2 for section headers, H3 for card titles.

### Animation & Interaction Principles

_Keep it minimal and purposeful._

1. **Fade-Ins:** Content sections should gently fade in (`fade-in-up`, 600ms) as
   the user scrolls.
2. **Buttons:**
   - _Hover:_ Slight scale up (`1.03x`) and brightness increase.
   - _Pulse:_ The "Donate" button in the nav can have a very subtle, slow pulse
     (every 8s).
3. **Cards & Compoonents:**
   - _Hover:_ Cards (Programmes, Team) should lift slightly (box-shadow
     increase) on hover.
4. **Carousels:** Manual swipe/click preferred over auto-play for accessibility.
   Transitions should be smooth (ease-out).

- **Use:**

    clothing).
  - **Abstract Shapes:** Use soft, organic blobs in brand colours (Blue/Green)
    as background patterns to break up white space.
  - **Icons:** Use a consistent line-art or duotone style. (e.g., Heroicons or
    Lucide-React).

## 5. Mobile & Accessibility Checklist

- [ ] **Contrast:** Ensure Orange buttons have white text (or dark if needed for
      contrast).
- [ ] **Touch Targets:** All buttons must be at least 44x44px.
- [ ] **Alt Text:** All images must have descriptive alt text (e.g., "Group of
      women learning tailoring skills").
